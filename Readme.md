# Disbott

## A bot for Discord

We're currently in the middle of a major rewrite to port the system over to C# from JS which is new for everyone involved.
The reason is just because both myself & @80cmdude are both learning C# and wanted a project where we can learn and apply ourselves too.

We're using https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net/tree/dev as our wrapper.
You're more than welcome to help out though please provide comments of what you are doing so we can learn.

I'd still recommend the javascript branch for the moment if you wish to use Disbott and we hope to get feature parity soon.
